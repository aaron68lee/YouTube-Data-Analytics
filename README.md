# YouTube-Data-Analytics

Embedding user search and watch history using image2vec and word2vec embeddings CV and NLP and performing clustering algorithms to compare users

# Inspiration

This ML project is an extension of the [people2vec](https://github.com/hametar0u/people2vec) project with added clustering, labeled metadata for visualization, and ability to compute topic models from generated cluster files.

# User Clustering

PCA and K-means clustering was performed on user youtube watched video embeddings.
Similarity metrics between users was calculated using FID, cosine similarity, and Euclidian distance metrics averaged over all user feature vectors.
Visualizations of multiple users can be seen using Tensorflow Projection
